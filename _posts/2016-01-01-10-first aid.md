# BASIC CLEANLINESS AND PROTECTION

When a person is hurt, the most important thing is to help. But you also must protect yourself from HIV and other blood-borne diseases. When someone is bleeding:

  1. If possible, show the injured person how to stop the bleeding themselves, by applying direct pressure on the wound.
  2. If they cannot do this, keep the blood off yourself by wearing gloves or a clean plastic bag on your hands, and placing a clean, thick cloth directly over the wound before applying pressure.

Avoid objects soiled with blood. Be careful not to prick yourself with needles or other sharp objects around the person you are helping. Cover cuts or other wounds with dry, clean bandages to protect them.

Be especially careful when you have to provide first aid where there are many people wounded from an accident or fighting.

If you do get blood or other body fluids on you, wash your hands with soap and water as soon as possible. If other parts of your body were touched by body fluids (especially your eyes), wash them thoroughly with lots of water.

#FEVER

When a person’s body temperature is too hot, he has a fever. Fever is not a sickness, but a sign of many different sicknesses. A high fever (over 39°C or over 102°F) can be a sign of a dangerous problem, especially in a small child.
When a person has a fever:

  1. Uncover him completely. Small children should be undressed completely and left naked until the fever goes down.

  **Never wrap the child in clothing or blankets. To wrap up a child with fever is dangerous**

  Fresh air or a breeze will not harm a person with fever. On the contrary, a fresh breeze helps lower the fever.

  2. Also take aspirin to lower fever (see p. 378). For children, it is safer to give acetaminophen (paracetamol, p. 380). Be careful not to give too much.

  3. Anyone who has a fever should drink lots of water, juices, or other liquids. For small children, especially babies, drinking water should be boiled first (and then cooled). Make sure the child passes urine regularly. If she does not pass much urine, or the urine is dark, give a lot more water.

  4. When possible, find and treat the cause of the fever.


# Very High Fevers

A very high fever can be a sign of a dangerous illness. Bring the fever down as soon as you can and treat the cause of the fever, if possible. High fever can cause seizures (convulsions) and is most dangerous for small children.

## When a fever goes very high (over 40°), it must be lowered at once:

  1. Put the person in a cool place.
  2. Remove all clothing.
  3. Fan him.
  4. Pour water over him, or put cloths soaked in cool water on his chest and forehead. Fan the cloths and change them often to keep them cool. Continue to do this until the fever goes down (below 38°).
  5. Give him plenty of cool (not cold) water to drink.
  6. Give a medicine to bring down fever. Aspirin or acetaminophen works well, but for children under 12 years old it is safer to use acetaminophen.


Dosage for acetaminophen (using 300 mg. adult tablets):

- Persons over 12 years: 2 tablets every 4 hours
- Children 6 to 12 years: 1 tablet every 4 hours
- Children 3 to 6 years: 1/2 tablet every 4 hours
- Children under 3 years: 1/4 tablet every 4 hours

If a person with fever cannot swallow the tablets, grind them up, mix the powder with some water, and put it up the anus as an enema or with a syringe without the needle.

>**If a high fever does not go down soon, if the person is unconscious, or if seizures (fits, convulsions) begin, continue cooling with water and seek medical help at once.**

# SHOCK

Shock is a life threatening condition that can result from a large burn, losing a lot of blood, severe illnesses, dehydration, or severe allergic reaction. Heavy bleeding inside the body—although not seen—can also cause shock.

Signs of SHOCK:

  - weak, rapid pulse (more than 100 per minute for an adult, more than 140 per minute for a child over 2 years old, and more than 190 per minute for a baby)
  - ‘cold sweat’; pale, cold, damp skin
  - blood pressure drops dangerously low
  - mental confusion, weakness, or loss of consciousness.

What to do to prevent or treat shock:

At the first sign of shock, or if there is risk of shock:

  - Loosen any belts or tight clothing the person may be wearing.
  - Have the person lie down with his feet a little higher than his head, like this: However, if he has a severe head injury, put him in a ‘half sitting’ position (p. 91).
  - Stop any bleeding. Use gloves or a plastic bag to keep the blood off your hands.
  - If the person feels cold, cover him with a blanket.
  - If he is conscious and able to drink, give him sips of water or other drinks. If he looks dehydrated, give a lot of liquid, and Rehydration Drink (p. 152). If he does not respond quickly, give intravenous fluids if you know how.
  - Treat his wounds, if he has any.
  - If he is in pain, give him aspirin or another pain medicine—but not one with a
  sedative such as codeine.
  - Keep calm, reassure the person, and seek medical help.
  If the person is unconscious:
  - Lay him on his side with his head low.
  - If he has vomited, clear his mouth immediately. Be sure his head is low, tilted back, and to one side (see above) so he does not breathe vomit into his lungs. If he has a neck or spine injury, do not tilt his head or move his back.
  - Do no give him anything by mouth until he becomes conscious.
  - If you or someone nearby knows how, give intravenous solution (normal saline)
  at a fast drip.
  - Seek medical help fast.
