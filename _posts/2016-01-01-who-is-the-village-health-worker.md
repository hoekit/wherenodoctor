# Who is the village health worker?

A village health worker is a person who helps lead family and neighbors toward better health. Often he or she has been selected by the other villagers as someone who is especially able and kind.

Some village health workers receive training and help from an organized program, perhaps the Ministry of Health. Others have no official position, but are simply members of the community whom people respect as healers or leaders in matters of health. Often they learn by watching, helping, and studying on their own.

In the larger sense, a village health worker is anyone who takes part in making his or her village a healthier place to live.

>This means almost everyone can and should be a health worker:

  - Mothers and fathers can show their children how to keep clean;

  - Farm people can work together to help their land produce more food;

  - Teachers can teach how to prevent and treat many common sicknesses and injuries;

  - Schoolchildren can share what they learn with their parents;

  - Shopkeepers can find out about the correct use of medicines they sell and give sensible advice and warning to buyers (see p. 338);

  - Midwives can counsel parents about the importance of eating well during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and family planning.


This book was written for the health worker in the larger sense. It is for anyone who wants to know and do more for his own, his family’s or his people’s well-being.

If you are a community health worker, an auxiliary nurse, or even a doctor, remember: this book is not just for you. It is for all the people. Share it!

>Use this book to help explain what you know to others.

Perhaps you can get small groups together to read a chapter at a time and discuss it.


THE VILLAGE HEALTH WORKER LIVES AND WORKS WITH HIS PEOPLE. HIS FIRST JOB IS TO SHARE HIS KNOWLEDGE.

# [w2](#page-w2)

Dear Village Health Worker,

This book is mostly about people’s health needs. But to help your village be a healthy place to live, you must also be in touch with their human needs. Your understanding and concern for people are just as important as your knowledge of medicine and sanitation.

Here are some suggestions that may help you serve your people’s human needs as well as health needs:

### 1. BE KIND.

A friendly word, a smile, a hand on the shoulder, or some other sign of caring often means more than anything else you can do. **Treat others as your equals**. Even when you are hurried or worried, try to remember the feelings and needs of others. Often it helps to ask yourself, “What would I do if this were a member of my own family?”

Treat the sick as people. Be especially kind to those who are very sick or dying. And be kind to their families. Let them see that you care.

HAVE COMPASSION.

Kindness often helps more than medicine. Never be afraid to show you care.

### 2. SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE.

As a health worker, your first job is to teach. This means helping people learn more about how to keep from getting sick. It also means helping people learn how to recognize and manage their illnesses—including the sensible use of home remedies and common medicines.

There is nothing you have learned that, if carefully explained, should be of danger to anyone. Some doctors talk about self-care as if it were dangerous, perhaps because they like people to depend on their costly services. But in truth, most common health problems could be handled earlier and better by people in their own homes.

LOOK FOR WAYS TO SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE.

### 3. RESPECT YOUR PEOPLE’S TRADITIONS AND IDEAS.

Because you learn something about modern medicine does not mean you should no longer appreciate the customs and ways of healing of your people. Too often the human touch in the art of healing is lost when medical science moves in. This is too bad, because. . .

>**If you can use what is best in modern medicine, together with what is best in traditional healing, the combination may be better than either one alone**


In this way, you will be adding to your people’s culture, not taking away.

Of course, if you see that some of the home cures or customs are harmful (for example, putting excrement on the freshly cut cord of a newborn baby), you will want to do something to change this. But do so carefully, with respect for those who believe in such things.

Never just tell people they are wrong. Try to help them understand WHY they should do something differently.

People are slow to change their attitudes and traditions, and with good reason. They are true to what they feel is right. And this we must respect.

Modern medicine does not have all the answers either. It has helped solve some problems, yet has led to other, sometimes even bigger ones. People quickly come to depend too much on modern medicine and its experts, to overuse medicines, and to forget how to care for themselves and each other.

So go slow—and always keep a deep respect for your people, their traditions, and their human dignity. Help them build on the knowledge and skills they already have.

WORK WITH TRADITIONAL HEALERS AND MIDWIVES— NOT AGAINST THEM.

Learn from them and encourage them to learn from you.

### 4. KNOW YOUR OWN LIMITS.

No matter how great or small your knowledge and skills, you can do a good job as long as you know and work within your limits. This means: Do what you know how to do. Do not try things you have not learned about or have not had enough experience doing, if they might harm or endanger someone.
But use your judgment.

Often, what you decide to do or not do will depend on how far you have to go to get more expert help.

For example, a mother has just given birth and is bleeding more than you think is normal. If you are only half an hour
away from a medical center, it may be wise to take her there right away.

But if the mother is bleeding very heavily and you are a long way from the health center, you may decide to massage her womb ([see page 265](page-265)) or inject a medicine to control bleeding ([see page 266](page-266)) even if you were not taught this.

Do not take unnecessary chances. But when the danger is clearly greater if you do nothing, do not be afraid to try something you feel reasonably sure will help.

Know your limits—but also use your head. Always do your best to protect the sick person rather than yourself.
