## about the original printed book

### where there is no doctor

#### A Village Health Care Book

First published in 1977 by [David Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Werner), Carol Thuman, Jane Maxwell.

Original title: Donde No Hay Doctor

ISBN 978-0-942364-15-6


**Where There Is No Doctor** is the most widely-used health care manual for health workers, educators, and others involved in primary health care and health promotion around the world. Current edition includes updated information on malaria, HIV, and more.

In the Journal of the American Medical Association, a 2010 review said, it is still not known if the book effectively improves health. However, in most of the world, where physicians are not available and diseases are rampant, the status quo is unacceptable. Until better solutions are created, Where There is No Doctor is probably a useful stop-gap measure.
