# THE USES, DOSAGE, AND PRECAUTIONS FOR THE MEDICINES REFERRED TO IN THIS BOOK

The medicines in this section are grouped according to their uses. For example, all the medicines used to treat infections caused by worms are listed under the heading FOR WORMS.

If you want information on a medicine, look for the name of that medicine in the LIST OF MEDICINES beginning on page 341. Or look for the medicine in the INDEX OF MEDICINES beginning on page 345. When you find the name you are looking for, turn to the page number shown.

Medicines are listed according to their generic (scientific) names rather than their brand names (names given by the companies that make them). This is because generic names are similar everywhere, but brand names differ from place to place. **Also, medicines are often much cheaper when you buy generic rather than brand‐name products.**

In a few cases, well-known brand names are given after the generic name. In this book brand names are written in italics and begin with a capital letter. For example, Phenergan is a brand name for an antihistamine called **promethazine** (promethazine is the generic name).

With the information on each medicine, blank spaces_____________ have
been left for you to **write in** the name and price of the most common or least expensive product in your area. For example, if the cheapest or only available form of tetracycline in your area is Terramycin, you would write in the blank spaces as follows:


>_Note:_ Not all the medicines listed in the Green Pages are needed in your Home or Village Medicine kit. Because different medicines are available in different countries, information has sometimes been given for a number of medicines that do the same job. However, it is wise to
>**KEEP AND USE ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF MEDICINES**

# Dosage Information:

## HOW FRACTIONS ARE SOMETIMES WRITTEN

1 tablet = one tablet

1⁄2 tablet = half a tablet

1⁄4 tablet = one quarter or one fourth of a tablet

1+1⁄2 tablets = one and a half tablets

1⁄8 tablet = one eighth of a tablet (dividing it into 8 equal pieces and taking 1 piece)

### DECIDING DOSAGE BY HOW MUCH A PERSON WEIGHS

In these pages most instructions for dosage are given according to the age of a person—so that children get smaller doses than adults. However, it is more exact to determine dosage according to a person’s weight. Information for doing this is sometimes included briefly in parentheses ( ), for use of health workers who have scales. If you read.

**(100 mg/kg/day),**

this means 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. In other words, during a
24 hour period you give 100 mg of the medicine for each kilogram the person weighs.

For example, suppose you want to give aspirin to a boy with rheumatic fever who weighs 36 kilograms. The recommended dose of aspirin for rheumatic fever is
100 mg/kg/day. So multiply:

**100 mg x 36 = 3600 mg**

The boy should get 3600 mg of aspirin a day. One aspirin tablet contains 300 mg of aspirin, so to get 3600 mg, he will need to take 12 tablets each day. So give the boy 2 tablets 6 times a day (or 2 tablets every 4 hours).

This is one way to figure the dosages for different medicines. For more information on measuring and deciding on dosages, see Chapter 8.

>Note to educators and planners of health care programs and to local distributors of this book:

>If this book is to be used in training programs for village health workers or is distributed by a local health care program, **information about local names and prices of medicines should accompany the book**.

>Local distributors are encouraged to duplicate a sheet with this information, so that it can be copied into the book by the user. Wherever possible, include local sources for **generic or low‐cost medicines and supplies**. (See “Buying Supplies for the Medicine Kit,” page 333.
