This chapter is about the prevention and treatment of problems seen mostly in older persons.

# SUMMARY OF HEALTH PROBLEMS DISCUSSED IN OTHER CHAPTERS

## Difficulties with Vision

(see p. 217)  
After the age of 40, many people have problems seeing close objects clearly. They are becoming farsighted. Often glasses will help.

Everyone over age 40 should watch for signs of glaucoma, which can cause blindness if left untreated. Any person with signs of glaucoma (see p. 222) should seek medical help.

Cataracts (see p. 225) and ‘floaters’ before the eyes (tiny moving spots, p. 227) are also common problems of old age.

## Weakness, Tiredness, and Eating Habits

Old people understandably have less energy and strength than when they were younger, but they will become even weaker if they do not eat well. Although older people often do not eat very much, they should eat some body building and protective foods every day (see pages 110 to 111).

## Swelling of the Feet

(see p. 176)  
This can be caused by many diseases, but in older people it is often caused by poor circulation or heart trouble (see p. 325). Whatever the cause, keeping the feet up is the best treatment. Walking helps too, but do not spend much time standing or sitting with the feet down. Keep the feet up whenever possible.

## Chronic Sores of the Legs or Feet

(see p. 213)  
These may result from poor circulation, often because of varicose veins (p. 175). Sometimes diabetes is part of the cause (p. 127).

For other possibilities, see page 20.

Sores that result from poor circulation heal very slowly.

Keep the sore as clean as possible. Wash it with boiled water and mild soap and change the bandage often. If signs of infection develop, treat as directed on p. 88.

When sitting or sleeping, keep the foot up.

## Difficulty Urinating

Difficulty Urinating (see p. 235)

## Chronic Cough

(see p. 168)
Older people who cough a lot should not smoke and should seek medical advice. If they had symptoms of tuberculosis when they were younger, or have ever coughed up blood, they may have tuberculosis.

If an older person develops a cough with wheezing or trouble breathing (asthma) or if his feet also swell, he may have heart trouble (see the next page).

## Rheumatoid Arthritis (painful joints)

(see p. 173)  
Many older people have arthritis. **To help arthritis:**

  - Rest the joints that hurt.
  - Apply hot compresses (see p. 195).
  - Take a medicine for pain; aspirin is best.
  For severe arthritis, take 2 to 3 aspirin tablets
  up to 6 times a day with bicarbonate of soda,
  an antacid (see p. 380), milk, or a lot of water. (If the ears begin to ring, take less.)
  - It is important to do exercises that help maintain as much movement as possible in the painful joints.


# OTHER IMPORTANT ILLNESSES OF OLD AGE

## Heart Trouble

Heart disease is more frequent in older people, especially in those who are fat, who smoke, or who have high blood pressure. Men and women share many of the same signs below, but women more often have unexplained tiredness, sleeping problems, and shortness of breath. Women also feel an ache or tightness in the chest more than the sharper pains felt by men.

### Signs of heart problems:

  - Anxiety and dif culty in breathing after exercise; asthma-like attacks that get worse when the person lies down (cardiac asthma).
  - A rapid, weak, or irregular pulse.
  - Swelling of the feet,  worse in the afternoons.

### Treatment:

  - Shortness of breath without exercise, unexplained tiredness, weakness, dizziness.
  - Sudden, painful attacks in the chest, left shoulder, or arm that occur when exercising and go away after resting for a few minutes (angina pectoris).
  - A sharp pain like a great weight crushing the chest; does not go away with rest (heart attack).
  - In women, a feeling like indigestion, nausea, clamminess, spasms, jaw pain (heart attack).
