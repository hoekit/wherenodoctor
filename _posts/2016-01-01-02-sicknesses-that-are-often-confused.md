# WHAT CAUSES SICKNESS?

Persons from different countries or backgrounds have different ways to explain what causes sickness.

_A baby gets diarrhea. But why?_

People in small villages may say it is because the parents did something wrong, or perhaps because they made a god or spirit angry.

A doctor may say it is because the child has an infection.

A public health officer may say it is because the villagers do not have a good water system or use latrines.

A social reformer may say the unhealthy conditions that lead to frequent childhood diarrhea are caused by an unfair distribution of land and wealth.

A teacher may place the blame on lack of education.
People see the cause of sickness in terms of their own experience and point of view. Who then is right about the cause? Possibly everyone is right, or partly right. This is because...

>Sickness usually results from a combination of causes

Each of the causes suggested above may be a part of the reason why a baby gets diarrhea.

To prevent and treat sickness successfully, it helps to have as full an understanding as possible about the common sicknesses in your area and the combination of things that causes them.

In this book, different sicknesses are discussed mostly according to the systems and terms of modern or scientific medicine.

To make good use of this book, and safe use of the medicines it recommends, you will need some understanding of sicknesses and their causes according to medical science. Reading this chapter may help.


# DIFFERENT KINDS OF SICKNESSES AND THEIR CAUSES

When considering how to prevent or treat different sicknesses, it helps to think of them in two groups: infectious and non-infectious.

**Infectious diseases** are those that spread from one person to another. Healthy persons must be protected from people with these sicknesses.

**Non-Infectious diseases** do not spread from person to person. They have other causes. Therefore, it is important to know which sicknesses are infectious and which are not.


# Non-infectious Diseases

Non-infectious diseases have many different causes. But they are never caused by germs, bacteria, or other living organisms that attack the body. They never spread from one person to another. It is important to realize that antibiotics, or medicines that fight germs (see p. 55), do not help cure non-infectious diseases.

>Remember: Antibiotics are of no use for non-infectious diseases.


### EXAMPLES OF NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASES

  - rheumatism

**Problems caused by something from outside that harms or troubles the body:**

  - poisons
  - snakebite
  - cough from smoking

**Problems caused by a lack of something the body needs:**
  - malnutrition
  - anemia

  - night blindness and xerophthalmia
  - goiter and hypothyroidism
  - cirrhosis of the liver (part of the cause)

**Problems people are born with:**
  - harelip
  - crossed or wall-eyes (squint)
  - other deformities
  - epilepsy (some kinds)
  - mental slowness

**Problems that begin in the mind (mental illnesses):**
  - fear that something is harmful when it is not (paranoia)
  - nervous worry (anxiety)
  - belief in hexes (witchcraft)
  - uncontrolled fear (hysteria)

# Infectious Diseases

Infectious diseases are caused by bacteria and other organisms (living things) that harm the body. They are spread in many ways. Here are some of the most important kinds of organisms that cause infections and examples of sicknesses they cause:
