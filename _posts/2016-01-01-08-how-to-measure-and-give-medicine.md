# SYMBOLS:

= means: is equal to or is the same as

+ means: and or plus


# HOW FRACTIONS ARE SOMETIMES WRITTEN:

1 tablet = one whole tablet = 1/2 tablet = half of a tablet

1 1/2 tablet = one and one-half tablets

1/4 tablet = one quarter, or one-fourth of a tablet

1/8 tablet = one-eighth of a tablet (dividing it into 8 equal pieces and taking 1 piece)

# MEASURING

Medicine is usually weighed in grams (g), milligrams (mg), or micrograms (mcg).

1000 mg = 1 g (one thousand milligrams make one gram)

1 mg = 0.001 g (one milligram is one one-thousandth part of a gram)

1000 mcg = 1 mg (one thousand micrograms make one milligram)


Examples:

- One adult aspirin tablet contains 300 milligrams
of aspirin. (.3 g, 0.3 g, 0.300 g, 300 mg. All these are different ways of saying 300 milligrams.)


- One baby aspirin contains 75 milligrams of aspirin. ( .075 g, 0.075 g, 75.0 mg, 75 mg. All these are different ways of saying 75 milligrams. )


**_Note:_** In some countries some medicines are still weighed in grains; gr = grain and 1 gr = 65 mg. This means a 5 gr aspirin tablet weighs about 300 mg.


Many times it is important to know how many grams or milligrams are in a medicine.

For example, if you want to give a small piece of adult aspirin to a child, instead of baby aspirin, but you do not know how big a piece to give...

read the small print on the labels of each. It says: aspirin: acetylsalicylic acid 0.3 g. (acetylsalicylic acid = aspirin)

0.3 g = 300 mg and 0.075 g = 75 mg. So, you can see that one adult aspirin weighs 4 times as much as one baby aspirin.


So if you cut an adult aspirin into 4 pieces, you can give the child 1 piece in place of a baby aspirin. Both are equal, and the piece of adult aspirin costs less.


**_CAUTION:_** Many medicines, especially the antibiotics, come in different weights and sizes. For example, tetracycline may come in 3 sizes of capsules:

- 250mg
- 100mg
- 50mg


Be careful to only give medicine in the recommended amounts. It is very important to check how many grams or milligrams the medicine contains.

For example: if the prescription says: Take tetracycline, 1 capsule of 250 mg 4 times a day, and you have only 50 mg capsules, you have to take five 50 mg capsules 4 times a day (20 capsules a day).

50 mg + 50 mg + 50 mg + 50 mg + 50 mg = 250 mg

# MEASURING PENICILLIN

Penicillin is often measured in units.

U = unit 1,600,000 U = 1 g or 1,000 mg

Many forms of penicillin (pills and injections) come in doses of 400,000 U. 400,000 U = 250 mg

# MEDICINE IN LIQUID FORM

Syrups, suspensions, tonics, and other liquid medicines are measured in milliliters:

ml = milliliter 1 liter = 1000 ml

Often liquid medicines are prescribed in tablespoons or teaspoons:

- 1 teaspoon (tsp) = 5 ml
- 1 tablespoon (Tbs) = 15 ml
- 3 teaspoons = 1 tablespoon

When instructions for a medicine say: Take 1 tsp, this means take 5 ml.

Many of the ‘teaspoons’ people use hold as much as 8 ml or as little as 3 ml.

>When using a teaspoon to give medicine, it is important that it measure 5 ml. No more, no less.

# How to Make Sure that the Teaspoon Used for Medicine Measures 5 ml

  1. Buy a 5 ml measuring spoon.

  2. Buy a medicine that comes with a plastic spoon. This measures 5 ml when it is full and may also have a line that shows when it is half full (2.5 ml). Save this spoon and use it to measure other medicines.

  3. Fill any small spoon that you have at home with 5 ml of water, using a syringe or something else to measure, and make a mark on the spoon at the level of the liquid.

# HOW TO GIVE MEDICINES TO SMALL CHILDREN

Many medicines that come as pills or capsules also come in syrups or suspensions (special liquid form) for children. If you compare the amount of medicine you get, the syrups are usually more expensive than pills or capsules. You can save money by making your own syrup in the following way:
