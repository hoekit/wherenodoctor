# BOTH THESE FAMILIES LIVE IN POOR COMMUNITIES:

Some mothers and fathers want a lot of children—especially in countries where poor people are denied a fair share of land, resources, and social benefits. This is because children help with work and provide care for their parents in old age. In such areas, having just a few children may be a privilege only wealthier people can afford.

The situation is different in countries where resources and benefits are fairly distributed. Where employment, housing, and health care are guaranteed and where women have equal opportunities for education and jobs, people usually choose to have smaller families. This is in part because they do not need to depend on their children for economic security.

In any society, parents have a right to make their own decisions about how many children to have, and when to have them.

Different parents have different reasons for wanting to limit the size of their families. Some young parents may decide to delay having any children until they have worked and saved enough so that they can afford to care for them well. Some parents may decide that a small number of children is enough, and they never want more. Others may want to space their children several years apart, so that both
the children and their mother will be healthier. Some parents feel they are too old to have more children. In some places, men and women know that if they have a lot of children, when the children grow up there may not be enough land for all of them to grow the food their families need.

# FAMILY PLANNING

Having the number of children you want, when you want them, is called family planning. If you decide to wait to have children, you can choose one of several methods to prevent pregnancy. These methods are called family planning methods, child spacing methods, or contraception.

Every year, half a million women die of problems from pregnancy, childbirth, and unsafe abortion. Most of these deaths could be prevented by family planning. For example, family planning can prevent dangers from pregnancies that are:

  - in young women. Women under the age of 18 are more likely to die in childbirth because their bodies are not fully grown. Their babies have a greater chance of dying in the first year.
  - in older women. Older women face more danger in child bearing, especially if they have other health problems or have had many children.
  - too close. A woman’s body needs time to recover between pregnancies.
  - too many. A woman with more than 4 children has a greater risk of death after
  childbirth from bleeding and other causes.

Millions of women safely use the family planning methods described in this chapter and on pages 393 to 396.

# Choosing a Family Planning Method

On the following pages, several methods of family planning are described. Each one works better for some people than others. Study these pages and talk with your midwife, health worker, or doctor about what methods are available and are likely to work best for you. As you read about each method, here are some questions you may want to consider:

  - How well does it prevent pregnancy? How effective is it?
  - How well does it protect against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, if at all?
  - How safe is it? If a woman has any of the health problems mentioned in this chapter, she may need to avoid some types of family planning methods.
  - How easy is it to use?
  - How much does it cost?
  - Is it easy to get? Will you need to visit the health center often?
  - Will the side effects (the problems the method may cause) create difficulties for you?

Family planning methods work best when both the man and the woman take responsibility for preventing pregnancy and protecting each other from sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

The chart on the next page shows how well each family planning method works to prevent pregnancy and to protect against STIs. When a man and a woman use a method correctly every time they have sex, the method will work better.
