# DANGER SIGNS

The eyes are delicate and need good care. Get medical help fast when any of the following danger signs occurs:

  1. Any injury that cuts or ruptures (goes through) the eyeball.
  2. Painful, grayish spot on the cornea, with redness around the cornea (corneal ulcer).
  3. Great pain inside the eye (possibly iritis or glaucoma).
  4. A big difference in the size of the pupils when there is pain in the eye or the head.
  5. Blood behind the cornea inside the eyeball (see p. 225)
  6. If vision begins to fail in one or both eyes.
  7. A white glow or reflection in the pupil. This could be a sign of cancer (retinoblastoma) or a cataract (see p. 225).
  8. Any eye infection or inflammation that does not get better after 5 or 6 days of treatment with an antibiotic eye ointment.

_A big difference in the size of the pupils may come from brain damage, stroke, injury to the eye, glaucoma, or iritis. (A small difference is normal in some people.)_

# INJURIES TO THE EYE

All injuries to the eyeball must be considered dangerous, for they may cause blindness.

Even small cuts on the cornea (the transparent layer covering the pupil and iris) may get infected and harm the vision if not cared for correctly.

If a wound to the eyeball is so deep that it reaches the black layer beneath the outer white layer, this is especially dangerous.

If a blunt injury (as with a fist) causes the eyeball to fill with blood, the eye is in danger (see p. 225). Danger is especially great if pain suddenly gets much worse after a few days, for this is probably acute glaucoma (p. 222).

### Treatment:

- If the person still sees well with the injured eye, put an antibiotic eye ointment (p. 378) in the eye and cover it with a soft, thick bandage. If the eye is not better in a day or two, get medical help.
- If the person cannot see well with the injured eye, if the wound is deep, or if there is blood inside the eye behind the cornea (p. 225), cover the eye with a clean bandage and go for medical help at once. Do not press on the eye.
- Do not try to remove thorns or splinters that are tightly stuck in the eyeball. Get medical help.

# HOW TO REMOVE A SPECK OF DIRT FROM THE EYE

Have the person close her eyes and look to the left, the right, up and down. Then, while you hold her eye open, have her look up and then down. This will make the eye produce more tears and the dirt often comes out by itself.

Or you can try to remove the bit of dirt or sand by flooding the eye with clean water (p. 219) or by using the corner of a clean cloth or some moist cotton. If the particle of dirt is under the upper lid, look for it by turning the lid up over a thin stick. The person should look down while you do this:

_The particle is often found in the small groove near the edge of the lid. Remove it with the corner of a clean cloth._



If you cannot get the particle out easily, use an antibiotic eye ointment, cover the eye with a bandage, and go for medical help.


# CHEMICAL BURNS OF THE EYE

Battery acid, lye, gasoline, or a pesticide that gets into the eye can be dangerous. Hold open the eye. Immediately flood the eye with clean, cool water. Keep flooding for
30 minutes, or until it stops hurting. Do not let the water get into the other eye.

# RED, PAINFUL EYES—DIFFERENT CAUSES

Many different problems cause red, painful eyes. Correct treatment often depends on finding the cause, so be sure to check carefully for signs of each possibility. This chart may help you find the cause:
