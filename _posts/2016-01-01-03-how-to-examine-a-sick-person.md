To find out the needs of a sick person, first you must ask important questions and then examine him carefully. You should look for signs and symptoms that help you tell how ill the person is and what kind of sickness he may have.

Always examine the person where there is good light, preferably in the sunlight — **never** in a dark room.

There are certain basic things to ask and to look for in anyone who is sick. These include things the sick person feels or reports (symptoms), as well as things you notice on examining him (signs). These signs can be especially important in babies and persons unable to talk. In this book the word ‘signs’ is used for both symptoms and signs.

>When you examine a sick person, write down your findings and keep them for the health worker in case he is needed (see p. 44).


# QUESTIONS

Start by asking the person about her sickness. Be sure to ask the following:
What bothers you most right now?

What makes you feel better or worse?

How and when did your sickness begin?

Have you had this same trouble before, or has anyone else in your family or neighborhood had it?

Continue with other questions in order to learn the details of the illness. For example, if the sick person has a pain, ask her:

Where does it hurt? (Ask her to point to the exact place with one finger.)

Does it hurt all the time, or off and on?

What is the pain like? (sharp? dull? burning?)

Can you sleep with the pain?

If the sick person is a baby who still does not talk, look for signs of pain. Notice his movements and how he cries. (For example, a child with an earache sometimes rubs the side of his head or pulls at his ear.)



# GENERAL CONDITION OF HEALTH

Before touching the sick person, look at him carefully. Observe how ill or weak he looks, the way he moves, how he breathes, and how clear his mind seems. Look for signs of dehydration (see p. 151) and of shock (p. 77).

Notice whether the person looks well nourished or poorly nourished. Has he been losing weight? When a person has lost weight slowly over a long period of time, he may have a chronic illness (one that lasts a long time).

Also note the color of the skin and eyes. These sometimes change when a person is sick. (Dark skin can hide color changes. So look at parts of the body where the skin is pale, such as palms of the hands or soles of the feet, the fingernails, or the insides of the lips and eyelids.)

• Paleness, especially of the lips and inside the eyelids, is a sign of anemia (p. 124). Skin may also go lighter as a result of tuberculosis (p. 179), or kwashiorkor (p. 113).

• Darkening of the skin may be a sign of starvation (see p. 112).

• Bluish skin, especially blueness or darkness of the lips and fingernails, may mean
serious problems with breathing (p. 79, 167, and 313) or with the heart
(p. 325). Blue-gray color in an unconscious child may be a sign of cerebral malaria (p. 186).

• A gray-white coloring, with cool moist skin, often means a person is in shock (p. 77).

• Yellow color (jaundice) of the skin and eyes may result from disease in the liver (hepatitis, p. 172, cirrhosis, p. 328, or amebic abscess, p. 145) or gallbladder (p. 329). It may also occur in newborn babies (p. 274), and in children born with sickle cell disease (p. 321).
Look also at the skin when a light is shining across it from one side. This can show the earliest sign of measles rash on the face of a feverish child (p. 311).


# TEMPERATURE

It is often wise to take a sick person’s temperature, even if he does not seem to have a fever. If the person is very sick, take the temperature at least 4 times each day and write it down.

If there is no thermometer, you can get an idea of the temperature by putting the back of one hand on the sick person’s forehead and the other on your own or that of another healthy person. If the sick person has a fever, you should feel the difference.

It is important to find out when and how the fever comes, how long it lasts, and how it goes away. This may help you identify the disease. Not every fever is malaria, though in some countries it is often treated as such. Remember other possible causes.

For example:

  • Common cold, and other virus infections (p. 163). The fever is usually mild.

  • Typhoid causes a fever that goes on rising for 5 days. Malaria medicine does not help.

  • Tuberculosis sometimes causes a mild fever in the afternoon. At night the person often sweats, and the fever goes down.

# HOW TO USE A THERMOMETER

Every family should have a thermometer. Take the temperature of a sick person
4 times a day and always write it down (see p. 462).

How to read the thermometer (using one marked in degrees centigrade—°C):

 - Turn the thermometer until you can see the silver line.

 - The point where the silver line stops marks the temperature.

 - Normal: 37

 - Fever: 37 > 39

 - High Fever: 39 > 42

## How to take the temperature:

 1. Clean the thermometer well with soap and water or alcohol. Shake it hard, with a snap of the wrist, until it reads less than 36 degrees.

 2. Put the thermometer:

    - under the tongue (keeping the or mouth shut)

    - in the armpit if there is danger of biting or the thermometer

    - carefully, in the anus of a small child (wet or grease it first)

 3. Leave it there for 3 or 4 minutes.

 4.  Read it. (An armpit temperature will read a little lower than a mouth reading; in the anus it will read a little higher.)

 5. Wash the thermometer well with soap and water.

_Note:_ In newborn babies a temperature that is unusually high or unusually low (below 36° C) may mean a serious infection (see p. 275).

# BREATHING (RESPIRATION)

Pay special attention to the way the sick person breathes—the depth (deep or shallow), rate (how often breaths are taken), and difficulty. Notice if both sides of the chest move equally when she breathes.

If you have a watch or simple timer, count the number of breaths per minute (when the person is quiet).

Between 12 and 20 breaths per minute is normal for adults and older children. Up to 30 breaths a minute is normal for younger children, and 40 for babies.

People with a high fever or serious respiratory illness breathe more quickly than normal. For example, more than 30 shallow breaths a minute in an adult usually means pneumonia, as does 60 breaths a minute for a newborn baby.

Listen carefully to the sound of the breaths. For example:

  • A whistle or wheeze and difficulty breathing out can mean asthma (see p. 167).

  • A gurgling or snoring noise and difficult breathing in an unconscious person
  may mean the tongue, mucus (slime or pus), or something else is stuck in the throat and does not let enough air get through.

Look for ‘sucking in’ of the skin between ribs and at the angle of the neck (behind the collar bone) when the person breathes in. This means air has trouble getting through. Consider the possibility of something stuck in the throat (p. 79), pneumonia (p. 171), asthma (p. 167), or bronchitis (mild sucking in, see p. 170).

If the person has a cough, ask if it keeps her from sleeping. Find out if she coughs up mucus, how much, its color, and if there is blood in it.

Pay attention to the strength, the rate, and the regularity of the pulse. If you have a watch or timer, count the pulses per minute.
