**The urinary system** or tract serves the body by removing waste material from the blood and getting rid of it in the form of urine:

  - The kidneys filter the blood and form the urine.

  - The ureters are tubes that carry urine to the bladder.

  - The bladder is a bag that stores the urine. As it fills, it stretches and gets bigger.

  - The urine tube or urinary canal (urethra) carries urine out through
  the penis in men or to a small opening between the lips of the vagina in women.

**The genitals are the sex organs.**

### The man:

- bladder urine canal
- penis or male sex organ
- scrotum or sac that holds the testicles
- sperm tube
- The prostate gland makes the liquid that carries the sperm.
- The testicles make the sperm, or microscopic cells with tails that join with the egg of a woman and make her pregnant.

### The woman:

- outer lips of the vagina
- inner lips
- anus: end of the intestine
- clitoris: a very sensitive spot that can give sexual pleasure when touched
- urinary opening: hole where urine comes out
- opening to the vagina or birth canal. (For inside view, see p. 280.)


# PROBLEMS OF THE URINARY TRACT

There are many different problems of the urinary tract. They are not always easy to tell apart. And the same illness can show itself differently in men and women. Some of these problems are not serious, while others can be very dangerous. A dangerous illness may begin with only mild signs. It is often difficult to identify these problems correctly by simply using a book like this one. Special knowledge and tests may be needed. When possible, seek advice from a health worker.

### Common problems with urinating include:

  1. Urinary tract infections. These are most common in women. (Sometimes they start
  after sexual contact, but may come at other times, especially during pregnancy.)
  2. Kidney stones, or bladder stones.
  3. Prostate trouble (difficulty passing urine caused by an enlarged prostate gland; most common in older men).
  4. Gonorrhea or chlamydia (infectious diseases spread by sexual contact that often cause difficulty or pain in passing urine).
  5. In some parts of the world schistosomiasis (blood flukes) is the most common cause of blood in the urine. This is discussed with other worm infections. See page 146.
