# DEHYDRATION

Most children who die from diarrhea die because they do not have enough water left in their bodies. This lack of water is called dehydration.

Dehydration results when the body loses more liquid than it takes in. This can happen with severe diarrhea, especially when there is vomiting too. It can also happen in very serious illness, when a person is too sick to take much food or liquid.

People of any age can become dehydrated, but dehydration develops more quickly and is most dangerous in small children.


>**Any child with watery diarrhea is in danger of dehydration**

It is important that everyone—especially mothers—know the signs of dehydration and how to prevent and treat it.


## Signs of dehydration:

  - thirst is often a first, early sign of dehydration
  - little or no urine; the urine is dark yellow
  - sudden weight loss
  - dry mouth
  - sunken, tearless eyes
  - sagging in of the ‘soft spot’ in infants
  - loss of elasticity or stretchiness of the skin


Very severe dehydration may cause rapid, weak pulse (see Shock, p. 77), fast, deep breathing, fever, or seizures (fits, convulsions, p. 178).

When a person has watery diarrhea, or diarrhea and vomiting, do not wait for signs of dehydration. **Act quickly** — read on.


To prevent or treat dehydration: When a person has watery diarrhea, act quickly:

  - Give lots of liquids to drink: Rehydration Drink is best. Or give a thin cereal porridge or gruel, teas, soups, or even plain water.
  - Keep giving food. As soon as the sick child (or adult) will accept food, give frequent feedings of foods he likes and accepts.
  - To babies, keep giving breast milk often—and before other drinks.

A special Rehydration Drink helps to prevent or treat dehydration, especially in cases of severe watery diarrhea:

## 2 WAYS TO MAKE ‘HOME MIX’ REHYDRATION DRINK

**WITH SUGAR AND SALT**

(Raw sugar or molasses can be used instead of sugar)

- In 1 liter of clean WATER put half of a level teaspoon of SALT and 8 level teaspoons of SUGAR.

- CAUTION: Before adding the sugar, taste the drink and be sure it is less salty than tears.

- To either Drink add half a cup of fruit juice, coconut water, or mashed ripe banana, if available. This provides potassium which may help the child accept more food and drink.

**WITH POWDERED CEREAL AND SALT**

(Powdered rice is best. Or use nely ground maize, wheat our, sorghum, or cooked and mashed potatoes.)

- In 1 liter of WATER put half a teaspoon of SALT And 8 heaping teaspoons (or 2 handfuls) of powdered CEREAL.

- Boil for 5 to 7 minutes to form a liquid gruel or watery porridge. Cool the Drink quickly and start giving it to the child.

- CAUTION: Taste the Drink each time before you give it to be sure it is not spoiled. Cereal drinks can spoil in a few hours in hot weather.

**IMPORTANT**

_**Adapt the Drink to your area. If liter containers or teaspoons are not in most homes, adjust quantities to local forms of measurement. Where people traditionally give cereal gruels to young children, add enough water to make it liquid, and use that. Look for an easy and simple way.**_


Give the dehydrated person sips of this Drink every 5 minutes, day and night, until he begins to urinate normally. A large person needs 3 or more liters a day.

A small child usually needs at least 1 liter a day, or 1 glass for each watery stool. Keep giving the Drink often in small sips, even if the person vomits. Not all of the Drink will be vomited.

**_WARNING:_** If dehydration gets worse or other danger signs appear, go for medical help (see p. 159). It may be necessary to give liquid in a vein (intravenous solution).

**_Note:_** In some countries packets of Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) are available for mixing with water. These contain a simple mix of sugar, salt, citrate, zinc, and potassium (see p. 381). However, homemade drinks—especially cereal drinks—when correctly prepared are often cheaper, safer, and more effective than ORS packets.


# DIARRHEA AND DYSENTERY

When a person has loose or watery stools, he has diarrhea. If mucus and blood can be seen in the stools, he has dysentery.

Diarrhea can be mild or serious. It can be acute (sudden and severe) or chronic (lasting many days).

Diarrhea is more common and more dangerous in young children, especially those who are poorly nourished.

Diarrhea has many causes. Usually no medicines are needed, and the child gets well in a few days if you give him lots of Rehydration Drink and food. (If he does not eat much, give him a little food many times a day.)

Occasionally, special treatment is needed. However, most diarrhea can be treated successfully in the home, even if you are not sure of the exact cause or causes.

# THE MAIN CAUSES OF DIARRHEA

  - poor nutrition (p. 154) weakens the child and makes diarrhea from other causes more frequent and worse
  - shortage of water and unclean conditions (no latrines) spread the germs that cause diarrhea
  - virus infection or ‘intestinal flu’
  - an infection of the gut caused by bacteria (p. 131), amebas (p. 144), or giardia (p. 145)
  - worm infections (p. 140 to 144) (most worm infections do not cause diarrhea)
  - infections outside the gut (ear infections, p. 309; tonsillitis, p. 309; measles, p. 311; urinary infections, p. 234)
  - malaria (falciparum type, in parts of Africa, Asia, the Paci c, Latin America and the Caribbean, p. 186)
  - food poisoning (spoiled food, p. 135)
  - HIV (long-lasting diarrhea may be an early sign of AIDS, p. 399)
  - inability to digest milk (mainly in severely malnourished children and certain adults)
  - difficulties babies have digesting foods that are new to them (p. 154)
  - allergies to certain foods (seafood, cray sh, etc., p. 166); occasionally babies are allergic to cow’s milk or other milks
  - side effects produced by certain medicines, such as ampicillin or tetracycline (p. 58)
  - laxatives, purges, irritating or poisonous plants, certain poisons
  - eating too much unripe fruit or heavy, greasy foods

### Preventing diarrhea:

Although diarrhea has many different causes, the most common are infection and poor nutrition. With good hygiene and good food, most diarrhea could be prevented. And if treated correctly by giving lots of drink and food, fewer children who get diarrhea would die.

Diarrhea is also very dangerous for people with HIV, especially children. Using cotrimoxazole can prevent diarrhea in persons with HIV (see p. 357).

Children who are poorly nourished get diarrhea and die from it far more often than those who are well nourished. Yet diarrhea itself can be part of the cause of malnutrition.


>**Malnutrition causes diarrhea. Diarrhea causes malnutrition**

And if malnutrition already exists, diarrhea rapidly makes it worse.

This results in a vicious circle, in which each makes the other worse. For this reason, good nutrition is important in both the prevention and treatment of diarrhea.

>**Prevent diarrhea by preventing malnutrition. Prevent malnutrition by preventing diarrhea**

To learn about the kinds of foods that help the body resist or fight off different illnesses, including diarrhea, read Chapter 11.

The prevention of diarrhea depends both on good nutrition and cleanliness. Many suggestions for personal and public cleanliness are given in Chapter 12. These include the use of latrines, the importance of clean water, and the protection of foods from dirt and flies.

Here are some other important suggestions for preventing diarrhea in babies:

  - Breastfeed rather than bottle feed babies. Give only breast milk for the first 6 months. Breast milk helps babies resist the infections that cause diarrhea. If it is not possible to breastfeed a baby, feed her with a cup and spoon. Do not use a baby bottle because it is harder to keep clean and more likely to cause an infection.


  - When you begin to give the baby new or solid food, start by giving her just a little, mashing it well, and mixing it with a little breast milk. The baby has to learn how to digest new foods. If she starts with too much at one time, she may get diarrhea. Do not stop giving breast milk suddenly. Start with other foods while the baby is still breastfeeding.

  - Keep the baby clean—and in a clean place. Try to keep her from putting dirty things in her mouth.

  - Do not give babies unnecessary medicines.


# Treatment of diarrhea:

For most cases of diarrhea no medicine is needed. If the diarrhea is severe, the biggest danger is dehydration. If the diarrhea lasts a long time, the biggest danger is malnutrition. So the most important part of treatment has to do with giving enough liquids and enough food. No matter what the cause of diarrhea, always take care with the following:

1. PREVENT OR CONTROL DEHYDRATION. A person with diarrhea must drink a lot of liquids. If diarrhea is severe or there are signs of dehydration, give him Rehydration Drink (p. 152). Even if he does not want to drink, gently insist that he do so. Have him take several swallows every few minutes.

2. MEET NUTRITIONAL NEEDS. A person with diarrhea needs food as soon as he will eat. This is especially important in small children or persons who are already poorly nourished. Also, when a person has diarrhea, food passes through the gut very quickly and is not all used. So give the person food many times a day—especially if he only takes a little at a time.

    - A baby with diarrhea should go on breastfeeding.
    - An underweight child should get plenty of energy foods and some body-building foods (proteins) all the time he has diarrhea—and extra when he gets well. If he stops eating because he feels too sick or is vomiting, he should eat again as soon as he can. Giving Rehydration Drink will help the child be able to eat. Although giving food may cause more frequent stools at first, it can save his life.
    - If a child who is underweight has diarrhea that lasts for many days or keeps coming back, give him more food more often—at least 5 or 6 meals each day. Often no other treatment is needed.
    - If possible, give zinc supplements to a baby or child with diarrhea (see p. 381).
