## Where There Is No Doctor
The most widely-used health care manual for health workers, educators, and others involved in primary health care and health promotion around the world. Current edition includes updated information on malaria, HIV, and more. 


In the Journal of the American Medical Association, a 2010 review said,

>it is still not known if the book effectively improves health. [However,] In most of the world, where physicians are not available and diseases are rampant, the status quo is unacceptable. Until better solutions are created, Where There is No Doctor is probably a useful stop-gap measure. [8](https://dx.doi.org/10.1001%2Fjama.2010.244)
