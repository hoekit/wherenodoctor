# SICKNESSES CAUSED BY NOT EATING WELL

Good food is needed for a person to grow well, work hard, and stay healthy. Many common sicknesses come from not eating enough.

A person who is weak or sick because he does not eat enough, or does not eat the foods his body needs, is said to be poorly nourished—or malnourished. He suffers from malnutrition.
Poor nutrition can result in the following health problems:


## in children

  - failure of a child to grow or gain weight normally (see p. 297)
  - slowness in walking, talking, or thinking
  - big bellies, thin arms and legs
  - common illnesses and
  infections that last longer, are more severe, and more often cause death
  - lack of energy, child is sad and does not play
  - swelling of feet, face, and hands, often with sores or marks on the skin
  - thinning, straightening, or loss of hair, or loss of its color and shine
  - poor vision at night, dryness of eyes, blindness


## in anyone

  - weakness and tiredness
  - loss of appetite
  - anemia
  - sores in the corners of the mouth
  - painful or sore tongue
  - ‘burning’ or numbness of the feet

_Although the following problems may have other causes, they are sometimes caused and are often made worse by not eating well:_

  - diarrhea
  - frequent infections
  - ringing or buzzing in the ears
  - headache
  - bleeding or redness of the gums
  - skin bruises easily
  - nosebleeds
  - stomach discomfort
  - dryness and cracking of the skin
  - heavy pulsing of the heart or of the ‘pit’ of the stomach (palpitations)
  - anxiety (nervous worry) and various nerve or mental problems • cirrhosis (liver disease)


**Poor nutrition during pregnancy** causes weakness and anemia in the mother and increases the risk of her dying during or after childbirth. It is also a cause of miscarriage, or of the baby being born dead, too small, or with a disability.


>Eating right helps the body resist sickness


Not eating well may be the direct cause of the health problems just listed. But most important, poor nutrition weakens the body’s ability to resist all kinds of diseases, especially infections:


  - Poorly nourished children are much more likely to get severe diarrhea, and to die from it, than are children who are well nourished.
  - Measles is especially dangerous where many children are malnourished.
  - Tuberculosis is more common, and gets worse more rapidly, in those who are malnourished.
  - Cirrhosis of the liver, which comes in part from drinking too much alcohol, is more common and worse in persons who are poorly nourished.
  - Even minor problems like the common cold are usually worse, last longer, or lead to pneumonia more often in persons who are poorly nourished.

>Eating right helps the sick get well


Not only does good food help prevent disease, it helps the sick body fight disease and become well again. So when a person is sick, eating enough nutritious food is especially important.

Unfortunately, some mothers stop feeding a child or stop giving certain nutritious foods when he is sick or has diarrhea—so the child becomes weaker, cannot fight off the illness, and may die. **Sick children need food! If a sick child will not eat, encourage him to do so.**

Feed him as much as he will eat and drink. And be patient. A sick child often does not want to eat much. So feed him something many times during the day. Also, try to make sure that he drinks a lot of liquid so that he pees (passes urine) several times a day. If the child will not take solid foods, mash them and give them as a mush or gruel.

Often the signs of poor nutrition first appear when a person has some other sickness. For example, a child who has had diarrhea for several days may develop swollen hands and feet, a swollen face, dark spots, or peeling sores on his legs. These are signs of severe malnutrition. The child needs more good food! And more often. Feed him many times during the day.


**During and after any sickness, it is very important to eat well.**


>EATING WELL AND KEEPING CLEAN ARE THE BEST GUARANTEES
OF GOOD HEALTH.

# WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO EAT RIGHT

People who do not eat right develop malnutrition. This can happen from not eating enough food of any kind (general malnutrition or ‘undernutrition’), from not eating the right kinds of foods (specific types of malnutrition), or from eating too much of certain foods (getting too fat, see p. 126).

Anyone can develop general malnutrition, but it is especially dangerous for:

  - children, because they need lots of food to grow well and stay healthy;
  - women of child bearing age, especially if they are pregnant or breastfeeding, because they need extra food to stay healthy, to have healthy babies, and to do their daily work;
  - elderly persons, because often they lose their teeth and their taste for food, so they cannot eat much at one time, even though they still need to eat well to stay healthy;
  - people with HIV, because they need more food to fight their infection.

A malnourished child does not grow well. She generally is thinner and shorter than other children. Also, she is more likely to be irritable, to cry a lot, to move and play less than other children, and to get sick more often. If the child also gets diarrhea or other infections, she will lose weight. A good way to check if a child is poorly nourished is to measure the distance around her upper arm.

**Checking Children for Malnutrition: The Sign of the Upper Arm**

After 1 year of age, any child whose middle
upper arm measures less than 11 1⁄2 cm. around is malnourished — no matter how ‘fat’ his feet, hands, and face may look. If the arm measures between 11 1⁄2 and 12 1⁄2 cm., he is at risk of becoming malnourished.

Another good way to tell if a child is well nourished or poorly nourished is to weigh him regularly: once a month in the first year, then once every 3 months. A healthy, well nourished child gains weight regularly. The weighing of children and the use of the Child Health Chart are discussed fully in Chapter 21.

# PREVENTING MALNUTRITION

To stay healthy, our bodies need plenty of good food. The food we eat has to fill many needs. First, it should provide enough energy to keep us active and strong. Also, it must help build, repair, and protect the different parts of our bodies. To do all this we need to eat a combination of foods every day.


MAIN FOODS AND HELPER FOODS
In much of the world, most people eat one main low-cost food with almost every meal. Depending on the region, this may be rice, maize, millet, wheat, cassava, potato, breadfruit, or banana. This main food usually provides most of the body’s daily food needs.
However, the main food alone is not enough to keep a person healthy. Certain helper foods are needed. This is especially true for growing children, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and older people.
Even if a child regularly gets enough of the main food to fill her, she may become thin and weak. This is because the main food often has so much water and fiber in it, that the child’s belly fills up before she gets enough energy to help her grow.
We can do 2 things to help meet such children’s energy needs:

  1. Feed children more often—at least 5 times a day when a child is very young, too thin, or not growing well. Also give her snacks between meals.

  >CHILDREN, LIKE CHICKENS, SHOULD ALWAYS BE PECKING.

  2. Also add high energy ‘helper foods’ such as oils and sugar or honey to the main food. It is best to add vegetable oil or foods containing oils—nuts, groundnuts (peanuts), or seeds, especially pumpkin or sesame seeds.

  >If the child’s belly fills up before her energy needs are met, the child will become thin and weak.

  >To meet her energy needs, a child would need to eat this much boiled rice.

  >ut she needs only this much rice when some vegetable oil is mixed in.

High energy foods added to the main food help to supply extra energy. Also, 2 other kinds of helper foods should be added to the main food:

When possible, add body–building foods (proteins) such as beans, milk, eggs, groundnuts, fish, and meat.

Also try to add protective foods such as orange or yellow fruits and vegetables, and also dark green leafy vegetables. Protective foods supply important vitamins and minerals.


#EATING RIGHT TO STAY HEALTHY

The ‘main food’ your family eats usually provides most—but not all—of the body’s energy and other nutritional needs. By adding helper foods to the main food you can make low cost nutritious meals. You do not have to eat all the foods listed here to be healthy. Eat the main foods you are accustomed to, and add whatever ‘helper foods’ are available in your area. Try to include ‘helper foods’ from each group, as often as possible.


REMEMBER: Feeding children enough and feeding them often (3 to 5 times a day) is usually more important than the types of food you feed them.


**_Note to nutrition workers:_** This plan for meeting food needs resembles teaching about ‘food groups’, but places more importance on giving enough of the traditional ‘main food’ and above all, giving frequent feedings with plenty of energy-rich helpers. This approach is more adaptable to the resources and limitations of poor families.
