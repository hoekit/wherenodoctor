Some medicines sold in pharmacies or village stores can be very useful. But many are of no value. Of the 60,000 medicines sold in most countries, the World Health Organization says that only about 200 are necessary.

Also, people sometimes use the best medicines in the wrong way, so that they do more harm than good. **To be helpful, medicine must be used correctly.**

Many people, including most doctors and health workers, prescribe far more medicines than are needed—and by so doing cause much needless sickness and death.

>There is some danger in the use of any medicine.

Some medicines are much more dangerous than others. Unfortunately, people sometimes use very dangerous medicines for mild sicknesses. (I have seen a baby die because his parents gave him a dangerous medicine, chloramphenicol, for a cold.) Never use a dangerous medicine for a mild illness.

>REMEMBER: MEDICINES CAN KILL.

Guidelines for the use of medicine:

 1. Use medicines only when necessary.
 2. Know the correct use and precautions for any medicine you use (see the GREEN PAGES).
 3. Be sure to use the right dose.
 4. If the medicine does not help, or causes problems, stop using it.
 5. When in doubt, seek the advice of a health worker.

_Note:_ Some health workers and many doctors give medicines when none is needed, often because they think patients expect medicine and will not be satisfied until they get some. Tell your doctor or health worker you only want medicine if it is definitely needed. This will save you money and be safer for your health.

Only use a medicine when you are sure it is needed and when you are sure how to use it.

#THE MOST DANGEROUS MISUSE OF MEDICINE

Here is a list of the most common and dangerous errors people make in using modern medicines. The improper use of the following medicines causes many deaths each year. BE CAREFUL!

  1. **Chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin)** (p. 356)

      The popular use of this medicine for simple diarrhea and other mild sicknesses is extremely unfortunate, because it is so risky. Use chloramphenicol only for very severe illnesses, like typhoid (see p. 188). Never give it to babies younger than 1 month old.

  2. **Oxytocin (Pitocin), Ergonovine (Ergotrate), and Misoprostol (Cytotec)** (p. 390-391)

      Unfortunately, some midwives use these medicines to speed up childbirth or ‘give strength’ to the mother in labor. This practice is very dangerous. It can kill the mother or the child. Use these medicines only to control bleeding after the child is born (see p. 266).

  3. **Injections of any medicine**

      The common belief that injections are usually better than medicine taken by mouth is not true. Many times medicines taken by mouth work as well as or better than injections. Also, most medicine is more dangerous injected than when taken by mouth. Injections given to a child who has a mild polio infection (with only signs of a cold) can lead to paralysis (see p. 74). Use of injections should be very limited (read Chapter 9 carefully).

  4. **Penicillin** (p. 350)

      Penicillin works only against certain types of infections. Use of penicillin for sprains, bruises, or any pain or fever is a great mistake. As a general rule, injuries that do not break the skin, even if they make large bruises, have no danger of infection; they do not need to be treated with penicillin or any other antibiotic. Neither penicillin nor other antibiotics helps colds (see p. 163).

      Penicillin is dangerous for some people. Before using it, know its risks and the precautions you must take—see pages 70 and 350.

  5. **Gentamicin  (Garamycin)** (p. 358)

      Too much use of this antibiotic for babies has caused permanent hearing loss (deafness) in millions of babies. Give to babies only for life-threatening infections. For many infections of the newborn, ampicillin works as well and is much less dangerous.

  6. **Anti-diarrhea medicines with hydroxyquinolines (Clioquinol, di-iodohydroxyquinoline, halquinol, broxyquinoline: Diodoquin, Enteroquinol, Amicline, Quogyl, and many other brand names)** (p. 369)

      In the past clioquinols were widely used to treat diarrhea. These dangerous medicines are now prohibited in many countries—but in others are still sold. They can cause permanent paralysis, blindness, and even death. For treatment of diarrhea, see Chapter 13.

  7. **Cortisone and cortico-steroids (Prednisolone, dexamethasone, and others)**

      These are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that are needed for severe attacks of asthma, arthritis, or severe allergic reactions. But in many countries, steroids are prescribed for minor aches and pains because they often give quick results. This is a big mistake. Steroids cause serious or dangerous side effects—especially if used in high doses or for more than a few days. They lower a person’s defenses against infection. They can make tuberculosis much worse, cause bleeding of stomach ulcers, and make bones so weak that they break easily.

  8. **Anabolic steroids (Nandrolone decanoate, Durabolin, Deca-Durabolin, Orabolin; stanozolol, Cetabon; oxymetholone, Anapolon; ethylestrenol, Organaboral. There are many other brand names.)**

      Anabolic steroids are made from male hormones and are mistakenly used in tonics to help children gain weight and grow. At first the child may grow faster, but he will stop growing sooner and end up shorter than he would have if he had not taken the medicine. Anabolic steroids cause very dangerous side effects. Girls grow hair on their faces like boys, which does not go away, even when the child stops taking the medicine. Do not give growth tonics to children. Instead, to help your child grow, use the money to buy food.

  9. **Arthritis medicines (Butazones: oxyphenbutazone, Amidozone; and phenylbutazone, Butazolidin)**

      These medicines for joint pain (arthritis) can cause a dangerous, sometimes deadly, blood disease (agranulocytosis). They can also damage the stomach, liver, and kidneys. Do not use these dangerous medicines. For arthritis, aspirin (p. 378) or ibuprofen (p. 379) is much safer and cheaper. For pain and fever only, acetaminophen (p. 379) can be used.

  10. **Vitamin B12, liver extract, and iron injections** (p. 392)

      Vitamin B12 and liver extract do not help anemia or ‘weakness’ except in rare cases. Also, they have certain risks when injected. They should only be used when a specialist has prescribed them after testing the blood. Also, avoid injectable iron, such as Imferon. To combat anemia, iron pills are safer and work as well (see p. 124).
