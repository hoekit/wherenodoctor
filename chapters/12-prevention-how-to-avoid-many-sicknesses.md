_An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure! If we all took more care to eat well, to keep ourselves, our homes, and our villages clean, and to be sure that our children are vaccinated, we could stop most sicknesses before they start.
In Chapter 11 we discussed eating well. In this chapter we talk about cleanliness and vaccination_

# CLEANLINESS—AND PROBLEMS THAT COME FROM LACK OF CLEANLINESS

Cleanliness is of great importance in the prevention of many kinds of infections— infections of the gut, the skin, the eyes, the lungs, and the whole body. Personal cleanliness (or hygiene) and public cleanliness (or sanitation) are both important.

Many common infections of the gut are spread from one person to another because of poor hygiene and poor sanitation. Germs and worms (or their eggs) are passed by the thousands in the stools or feces (shit) of infected persons. These are carried from the feces of one person to the mouth of another by dirty fingers or contaminated food or water. Diseases that are spread or transmitted from feces-to- mouth in this way, include:

  - diarrhea and dysentery (caused by amebas and bacteria)
  - intestinal worms (several types)
  - hepatitis, typhoid fever, and cholera
  - certain other diseases, like polio, are sometimes spread this same way

The way these infections are transmitted can be very direct.

For example: A child who has worms and who forgot to wash his hands after his last bowel movement, offers his friend a cracker. His fingers, still dirty with his own stool, are covered with hundreds of tiny worm eggs (so small they cannot be seen). Some of these worm eggs stick to the cracker. When his friend eats the cracker, he swallows the worm eggs, too.

Soon the friend will also have worms. His mother may say this is because he ate sweets. But no, it is because he ate shit!

Many times pigs, dogs, chickens, and other animals spread intestinal disease and worm eggs. For example:

  - A man with diarrhea or worms has a bowel movement behind his house

  - A pig eats his stool, dirtying its nose and feet.

  - Then the pig goes into the house.

  - In the house a child is playing on the  oor. In this way, a bit of the man’s stool gets on the child, too.

  - Later the child starts to cry, and the mother takes
  him in her arms.

  - Then the mother prepares food, forgetting to wash her hands after handling the child.

  - The family eats the food.

  - And soon, the whole family has diarrhea or worms.

Many kinds of infections, as well as worm eggs, are passed from one person to another in the way just shown.

If the family had taken any of the following precautions, the spread of the sickness could have been prevented:

  - if the man had used a latrine or out-house,
  - if the family had not let the pigs come into the house,
  - if they had not let the child play where the pig had been,
  - if the mother had washed her hands after touching the child and before preparing food.

If there are many cases of diarrhea, worms, and other intestinal parasites in your village, people are not being careful enough about cleanliness. If many children die from diarrhea, it is likely that poor nutrition is also part of the problem. To prevent death from diarrhea, both cleanliness and good nutrition are important (see p. 154 and Chapter 11).
