_When we revised Where There Is No Doctor in 1992, we added several topics. We continue to update these with each new edition. Some of these topics were specifically requested and others are problems that affect more and more people, such as HIV and AIDS, complications from unsafe abortions, pesticide poisoning, and drug addiction. We added the section on blood pressure because the book is used by many health workers who have equipment for measuring it._

# HIV AND AIDS

HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a very small germ, called a virus, that you cannot see without a microscope. AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is an illness that develops later, after a person has been infected with HIV for some time. HIV is now found all around the world.

HIV reduces the body’s ability to fight disease. A person with HIV can get sick very easily—from illnesses such as diarrhea, pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and certain types of cancer. Most people with AIDS die from diseases their bodies are no longer strong enough to fight.

HIV spreads when an HIV-infected person’s blood, semen (sperm), breast milk, or fluid from the vagina enters the body of a person without HIV. It can spread through:

  - **Unprotected sex** between someone who has HIV and someone who does not. This is the most common way HIV is spread.

  - **Using an unsterilized needle or syringe** (or any instrument that pierces or cuts the skin).

  - **Pregnancy**, birth or breastfeeding, which can pass HIV to a baby if the mother is infected. (See p. 398 for information on preventing HIV from spreading this way.)

  - **Blood transfusions**, if the blood has not been tested to be sure it is free from HIV.

**HIV is not spread through everyday contact** such as shaking hands, hugging, kissing, or living, playing, sleeping, or eating together. Also, it is not spread by food, water, insects, toilet seats, or communion cups. Caring for someone with HIV or AIDS is safe if you follow the advice on p. 401.

_IMPORTANT:_ **Someone who looks and feels completely healthy can have, and spread, HIV.** It may take years after the virus enters the body for the first signs of illness to appear. The only way to know for sure whether or not you have HIV is to get an HIV test. These tests are available at many health centers at low or no cost.

### Signs of AIDS:

A person has AIDS when the part of the body that fights disease, the immune system, gets so weak that it can no longer fight off infections. The signs of AIDS are different in different people. Often they are the typical signs of other common illnesses, but are more severe and last longer.

If a combination of these 3 signs appears and the person gets sick more and more often, he or she may have HIV (but you cannot be sure without an HIV test):

  - Gradual weight loss.
  - Diarrhea for more than 1 month.
  - A fever for more than 1 month, sometimes with chills or soaking night sweats.
  The person may also have one or more of these signs:
  - A bad cough that lasts for more than 1 month.
  - Yeast infection in the mouth (‘thrush,’ see p. 232).
  - Swollen lymph nodes, anywhere in the body (see p. 88).
  - Rashes or painless dark patches on the skin.
  - Warts or sores that keep growing and do not go away, especially around the genital area and buttocks.
  AIDS was called ‘slim disease’ in Africa because people lost so much weight.
  - Feels tired all the time.
  - People with HIV are more likely to get TB (p. 179) or shingles (p. 204).


### Treatment:

There is still no medicine to cure HIV or AIDS. But medicines called “antiretrovirals” can help people with HIV stay healthy and live longer. Taken in combination, they are called Antiretroviral Therapy, or ART. ART is becoming less costly and more available in many countries. (See pages 396 to 398 for information on ART.)

Because people with HIV have difficulty fighting infections, many use cotrimoxazole daily to prevent infections (see page 357). Be sure to treat any problems that occur:

  - For diarrhea, use Rehydration Drink (see p. 152).
  - For yeast infection in the mouth (thrush), use gentian violet, nystatin, or
  miconazole (see pages 232 and 372).
  - For warts, use trichloroacetic acid or podophyllin (see p. 373 and 402).
  - For fever, give lots of fluids, aspirin or acetaminophen, and lower high fever with a cool bath (see pages 75 and 76).
  - Treat cough by drinking lots of water and treat pneumonia with antibiotics (see pages 168 to 171). If cough and fever last more than a week, seek advice immediately about TB prevention and treatment for people with HIV (see pages 179 and 180).
  - For itching and rashes, use antihistamines (p. 385) and treat infections (p. 202).
  - Treat infected wounds and sores (see pages 88 and 89).
  - For shingles, see p. 204.

You can also stay as healthy as possible by eating well (see Chapter 11); purifying your drinking water; avoiding alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs; getting enough rest and sleep; and using a condom when having sex.


### Preventing HIV:

If possible, have sex with only one partner who has sex only with you.

  - Practice safer sex (see p. 290). Using a condom reduces the risk of getting or giving HIV.
  -Treat sexually transmitted infections early—especially those that cause sores.
  - Do not share the same needle or syringe or have an injection unless you are sure the instruments are sterilized first with bleach or by boiling for 20 minutes. Health workers should NEVER re-use a needle or syringe without sterilizing it first (see p. 74). Also make sure equipment for circumcision, ear piercing, acupuncture, and traditional practices such as scarring, is sterilized.
  - If possible, do not accept a transfusion of blood that has not first been tested. Avoid transfusions except when absolutely necessary.
  - Do not share razors.
  - Wear latex gloves or plastic bags on your hands if you touch someone else’s
  wound, blood, or body fluids.
  - If you were raped or had unprotected sex with someone who has HIV, take ART to prevent getting HIV. See page 398.
  - Treatment is prevention. All people with HIV, especially pregnant women, can take ART to improve their health and stop HIV from spreading.

Setting up treatment and testing programs will also help prevent HIV from spreading in your community. In the long run, HIV can best be prevented by fighting for fairer social and economic conditions, so that people have stronger bodies from better nutrition, so that families do not need to separate to find work, and so that people need not sell their bodies for sex.

>Be kind to persons with AIDS.

### Preventing HIV:

## CARING FOR SOMEONE WITH HIV OR AIDS:

People with HIV or AIDS need comfort, kindness, and emotional support. You can help them discuss how to tell their loved ones about their illness, and prepare the legal and social arrangements necessary to care for their children, family, and property. They may also need help getting enough to eat or taking their medicines.

If they have a lot of fever, diarrhea, or pain, they will need extra help staying clean. This can usually be done without risk. To prevent spreading the virus, remember:

- Blood, open sores, bloody diarrhea, or bloody vomit can spread the virus. To prevent touching these, wear rubber latex or plastic gloves, or plastic bags on your hands. Wash your hands often.

- Soiled or bloody clothes, bedding, or towels should be handled with care. Wash them in hot soapy water, or add chlorine bleach. Keep separate from other household laundry.

At some point, there is nothing more that can be done to treat a person with AIDS. At home, family and friends can give love and support to help the person prepare for his or her death (see p. 330).


# SORES ON THE GENITALS

A single, painless sore on the genitals may be a sign of syphilis (see p. 237). But several sores are likely to be a sign of other sexually transmitted infections: genital warts, genital herpes, or chancroid. HIV can easily pass through a sore on the genitals during sex. Always use a condom, and avoid having sex if the condom will not cover the sore.

# Genital Warts (Venereal warts, Condylomata acuminata)

These warts are caused by a virus that is spread by sexual contact. They look like warts on other parts of the body (see p. 210) but there are usually more of them.

### Signs:

Small, hard, whitish or brownish skin growths that have a rough surface. In men they usually grow on the penis but can also grow on the scrotum or anus. In women they grow on the lips of the vagina, inside the vagina, on the cervix, or around the anus.

### Treatment:

Apply a small amount of trichloroacetic acid or podophyllin
(see p. 373) to each wart. (If possible, first apply some Vaseline or other greasy ointment to the skin around each wart to protect the healthy skin.) Podophyllin must be washed off 6 hours later. Several treatments are usually necessary. The warts will slowly shrink and go away, but often return.

##Prevention:

The man should wear a condom (see p. 287) during sex if either he or his partner has genital warts.

>Using a condom each time you have sex helps prevent the spread of warts, herpes, chancroid, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections.

# Genital Herpes

Genital herpes is a painful skin infection caused by a virus. It produces sores on the genitals or in the mouth that come and go for months or years. Genital herpes is spread from person to person during sex, but not all sores on the mouth are spread by sex. Children and adults often get sores on their mouths caused by a different herpes virus when they have a cold or fever (see Cold Sores, p. 232).

### Signs:

  - One or more very small, painful blisters, like drops of water on the skin, appear on the genitals, anus, buttocks or thighs.
  - The blisters burst and form small, open sores that are very painful.
  - The sores dry up and become scabs.


The herpes sores can last for 3 weeks or more, with fever, aches, chills, and swollen lymph nodes in the groin. There may be pain when the woman pees.
The virus stays in the body after all the signs disappear. New blisters can appear at any time, from weeks to years later. Usually the new sores appear in the same place, but are fewer, not as painful, and heal more quickly.

### Treatment:

There is no medicine that cures herpes, but it can be controlled with acyclovir (see p. 373). Keep the area clean. Do not have sex until all the sores are healed— not even with a condom.

Always wash hands with soap and water after touching the sores. Be very careful not to touch the eyes. A herpes infection in the eyes can cause blindness.

_CAUTION:_ If a woman has herpes sores when she gives birth, her baby can get it. This is very dangerous. Let your health worker or midwife know if you have ever had genital herpes.

# Chancroid

### Signs:

  - soft, painful sores on the genitals or anus
  - enlarged lymph nodes (bubos) may develop in the groin

### Treatment:

  - Give 1 g of azithromycin by mouth in 1 dose, or erythromycin 500 mg by mouth, 4 times daily for 7 days, or ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth 2 times
  a day for 3 days. You can also give ceftriaxone, 250 mg by intramuscular injection, as a single dose. Pregnant women and children should not take ciprofloxacin.
  - Generally, it is best to treat for syphilis at the same time (see p. 237).


# CIRCUMCISION AND EXCISION (CUTTING AWAY SKIN FROM THE SEX PARTS)

In many communities, boy children are circumcised—as are girls in some parts
of the world—as a traditional ‘practice’ or ‘custom’. Circumcision is not necessary for health, although male circumcision may provide some protection against HIV. For boys it is usually not dangerous. But for girls, this practice—sometimes called ‘excision’, ‘infibulation’, or ‘female genital cutting’—is very dangerous and should be strongly discouraged. For both boys and girls, unclean cutting tools risk spreading HIV.

## BOYS

A baby boy is born with a tube of skin (foreskin) covering the ‘head’ of his penis. As long as urine comes out of the hole at the tip, there should be no problem. The foreskin will usually not pull back completely over the head of the penis until the boy is about 4 years old. This is normal and circumcision is not necessary. Do not try to pull the foreskin back by force.

However, if the foreskin becomes red, swollen, and so tight that the baby cannot pass urine without pain, this is not normal. Take him to a health worker for a circumcision as soon as possible.

As a family ritual, simple circumcision of a healthy baby boy may be done by a midwife or person with experience. Using a new razor, she cuts off a little of the foreskin beyond the head of the penis. After the cut, there is some bleeding. Hold the penis firmly with a clean cloth, or gauze, for 5 minutes, until the bleeding stops. Some healers use the juice of a plant to help stop the bleeding (see p. 13).

If the bleeding does not stop, wash away the clots of blood with clean water, and pinch the end of the foreskin between the fingers with a piece of clean cloth for as long as it takes the bleeding to stop. No medicine is needed.

## GIRLS

In circumcision of girls, or ‘excision’, the soft knob of flesh (clitoris) at the front end of the vagina is cut out. Sometimes, part of the vaginal lips is also cut away. Removing the clitoris is as bad as cutting off the head of a boy’s penis. Excision should not be done. Girls who have been excised may have frequent urinary and vaginal infections, and difficulty during childbirth.

There is also danger of severe bleeding during excision. The child can die in a few minutes. Act quickly. Wash away the clots to find the exact point where the blood is coming from and press on it firmly for 5 minutes. If bleeding continues, keep pressing the bleeding spot while you carry the child to a health worker or doctor for help. Watch for signs of shock (see page 77) and infection.

# SPECIAL CARE FOR SMALL, EARLY, AND UNDERWEIGHT BABIES—‘KANGAROOING’

A baby who is born very small (weighs less than 2 1⁄2 kg. or 5 pounds) will need special care. If possible, take the baby to a health post or hospital. In the hospital, these babies are often kept warm and protected in a special temperature–controlled box called an incubator. However, for a baby who is basically healthy, a mother can often provide similar warmth and protection by ‘kangarooing’ the baby:

  - Place the baby naked, with or without a diaper or nappy, upright inside your clothing against your skin, between your breasts. (It helps to wear a loose blouse, sweater, or wrap tied at the waist.)
  - Let the baby suck at your breast as often as he wants, but at least every 2 hours.
  - Sleep propped up so that the baby stays upright.
  - Wash the baby’s face and bottom each day.
  - Make sure the baby stays warm at all times. If it is cool, dress the baby with extra clothing, and cover his head.
  - While you bathe or rest, ask the father, or another family member, to ‘kangaroo’ the baby.
  - Take the baby to a health worker regularly. Be sure that he gets all his vaccinations (see p. 147).
  - Give the baby iron and vitamin supplements—especially vitamin D (see p. 392).

#LEISHMANIASIS

This disease is found in Africa, India, and the Middle East, and in southern Mexico, Central America and South America. The infection is carried from person to person by a small sand fly which infects a person when it bites.

Some forms of the disease cause damage inside the body (visceral leishmaniasis, kala–azar, dumdum fever). These are very difficult to recognize and the treatment is very complicated and expensive. If possible, seek medical help.

Other forms affect mainly the skin (cutaneous leishmaniasis, tropical sore, Delhi boil, espundia, forest yaws, uta, chiclero ulcer). These are easier to treat.

### Signs of leishmaniasis of the skin:

  - 2 to 8 weeks after being bitten, swelling appears where the fly bit.
  - The swelling becomes an open sore, usually with pus.
  - Sores can heal by themselves, but may take several weeks to 2 years.
  - Sores become infected (with bacteria) very easily.

### Treatment:

  - Clean the sore with cool, boiled water.
  - Apply a hot, moist cloth to the sore (not so hot that it burns the skin) for 10 to
  15 minutes.
  - Do this 2 times a day for 10 days. This ‘heat treatment’ often brings a complete cure.
  - If the sore looks infected (red and painful), also give antibiotics (see p. 351).

# GUINEA WORM

Guinea worm is a long, thin worm that lives under the skin and makes a painful sore on the ankle, leg, or elsewhere on the body. The worm, which looks like a white thread, can be over a meter long. Guinea worm is found in parts of Africa.
Guinea worm is spread from person to person, like this:

  1. Infected person with open sore wades into a water hole. The worm pokes its head out of the sore and lays thousands of eggs into the water.
  2. Tiny water-fleas pick up the worm eggs.
  3. Another person drinks some of the water. The fleas, with the worm eggs, are swallowed.
  4. Some of the eggs develop slowly into worms under the skin, but at first the person feels nothing. About one year later, a sore forms when an adult worm breaks through the skin to lay its eggs.

### Signs:

  - A painful swelling develops on the ankle, leg, testicles or elsewhere on the body.
  - After a week a blister forms, which soon bursts open forming a sore. This often happens when standing in water, or bathing. The end of a white thread-like Guinea worm can be seen poking out of the sore.
  - If the sore gets dirty and infected, the pain and swelling spread, and walking becomes impossible. Sometimes tetanus occurs (see p. 182).


### Treatment:

  - Keep the sore clean. Soak the sore in cold water until the worm’s head pokes out.
  - Attach a thread to the worm, or roll it round a thin stick, and pull gently, a little more each day. This may take a week or more. The worm can be more than a meter long! Try not to break it, because this can cause severe infection.
  - Give metronidazole or thiabendazole to help reduce discomfort and make it easier to slowly pull out the worm. (The medicines do not kill the worms. For dosages and precautions, see pages 368 and 374.)
  - Give anti-tetanus vaccination (p. 147).
  - If sores become infected (spreading pain, redness, swelling, and fever), give
  penicillin or dicloxacillin or a similar antibiotic (see p. 351).

### Prevention:

  - Use tap water for drinking, if available. If a water hole is the only supply, then do not drink from it directly. Pour the water into a special drinking water pot, through a clean cloth tied over the top. The cloth will filter out the infected water-fleas.
   - If the community can build stone steps into the water hole, people can scoop water from the last dry step without getting wet.
  Water low Water high
  ALWAYS USE THE LAST DRY STEP. NEVER STEP INTO THE WATER.
  - Or turn the water hole into a well, so that people can draw water with a rope and bucket.

 **If nobody wades or bathes in water used for drinking, the infection cannot be passed on, and will eventually disappear from the area.**


# EMERGENCIES CAUSED BY COLD

## Loss of Body Heat (Hypothermia)

In cold climates, or cold, wet or windy weather, persons who are not wearing enough warm clothes can lose the heat from their bodies. This is very dangerous. Often the person does not realize what is happening and can become so confused that she will not ask for help and may die.

### Signs:

  - Uncontrolled shivering
  - Slow or unclear speech
  - Stumbles when walking
  - Cannot think clearly
  - Feels very tired

### Treatment:

  - Quickly get the person to a dry place protected from the wind.
  - Take off wet clothes and cover person with dry clothing and dry blankets.
  - Make sure her head, feet, and hands are covered.
  - Heat stones in a fire, wrap them in cloth, and put them next to her back and belly.

  >WARNING: Do not warm up the person too fast as this could cause heart problems and death.

  - Do all you can to keep the person warm. If it is a child, wrap him inside your clothing against your skin (see ‘Kangarooing’, p. 405). Or sleep with him in your arms. If possible, have someone else lie on the other side. Or put pans of hot coals, or a few small oil lamps under the cot. (But be careful he does not get burned, or too warm.)
  - Give sweet things to eat and drink like sugar, candy, honey, ripe fruit or juice. If you do not have sweets, give starchy foods like rice, bread, plantain, or potatoes.
  - If the person stops breathing, give mouth-to-mouth breathing (see p. 80). Keep giving mouth-to-mouth breathing for at least 1 hour.
  If the person stops shivering but still has any of the above signs, or if he is unconscious, his condition is very serious. Keep trying to warm him, but if he does not wake up, get medical help FAST.
