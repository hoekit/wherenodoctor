# MENSTRUAL PERIOD (MONTHLY BLEEDING IN WOMEN)

Most girls have their first ‘period’ or monthly bleeding between the ages of 11 and 16. This means that they are now old enough to become pregnant.

The normal period comes once every 28 days or so, and lasts 3 to 6 days However, this varies a lot in different women.

Irregular or painful periods are common in adolescent (teenage) girls. This does not usually mean there is anything wrong.

**If your menstrual period is painful:**

 - There is no need for you to stay in bed. In fact, lying quietly can make the pain worse.

 - It often helps to walk around and do light work or exercises...

 - or to take hot drinks, or put your feet in hot water.

If it is very painful, it may help to take aspirin (p. 378) or ibuprofen (p. 379) and to lie down and put warm compresses on the belly.

During the period—as at all times—a woman should take care to keep clean, get enough sleep, and eat a well balanced diet. She can eat everything she normally eats and can continue to do her usual work. It is not harmful to have sex during the menstrual period. (However, if one of the partners has HIV, the risk of infecting the other partner may be higher.)
