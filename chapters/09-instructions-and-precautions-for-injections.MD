# WHEN TO INJECT AND WHEN NOT TO

Injections are not needed often. Most sicknesses that require medical treatment can be treated as well or better with medicines taken by mouth. Each year, millions of people—especially children—become ill, disabled, or die as a result of unnecessary injections. Combating misuse and overuse of medicines is as important to good health as vaccination, clean water, or the correct use of latrines. As a general rule:

>**It is more dangerous to inject medicine than to take it by mouth**

Injections should be used only when absolutely necessary. Except in emergencies, they should be given only by health workers or persons trained in their use.

The only times medicines should be injected are:

  1. When the recommended medicine does not come in a form that can be taken by mouth.
  2. When the person vomits often, cannot swallow, or is unconscious.
  3. In certain unusual emergencies and special cases (see the next page).

# WHAT TO DO WHEN THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBES INJECTIONS

Doctors and other health workers sometimes prescribe injections when they are not needed. After all, they can charge more money for injections. They forget the problems and dangers of giving injections in rural areas.

  1. If a health worker or healer wants to give you an injection, be sure the medicine is appropriate and that she takes all the necessary precautions.
  2. If a doctor prescribes injections, explain that you live where no one is well trained to give injections and ask if it would be possible to prescribe a medicine to take by mouth.
  3. If a doctor wants to prescribe injections of vitamins, liver extract, or vitamin B12, but has not had your blood tested, tell him you would prefer to see another doctor.


# EMERGENCIES WHEN IT IS IMPORTANT TO GIVE INJECTIONS

In case of the following sicknesses, get medical help as fast as you can. If there will be any delay in getting help or in taking the sick person to a health center, inject the appropriate medicine as soon as possible. For details of the doses, consult the pages listed below. Before injecting, know the possible side effects and take the needed precautions (see the Green Pages).
