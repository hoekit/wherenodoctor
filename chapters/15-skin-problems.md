Some skin problems are caused by diseases or irritations that affect the skin only—such as ringworm, diaper rash, or warts. Other skin problems are signs of diseases that affect the whole body—such as the rash of measles or the sore, dry patches of pellagra (malnutrition). Certain kinds of sores or skin conditions may be signs of serious diseases—like tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, or HIV infection.

This chapter deals only with the more common skin problems in rural areas. However, there are hundreds of diseases of the skin. Some look so much alike that they are hard to tell apart—yet their causes and the specific treatments they require may be quite different.

>**If a skin problem is serious or gets worse in spite of treatment, seek medical help**

Many skin problems can be helped by keeping the body clean. Try to wash once a day with mild soap and clean water. If the skin becomes too dry, wash less often and do not use soap every time. Try rubbing petroleum gel (Vaseline), glycerin, or vegetable oils into the skin after bathing. Wear loose cotton clothing.


# GENERAL RULES FOR TREATING SKIN PROBLEMS

Although many skin problems need specific treatment, there are a few general measures that often help:

 1. If the affected area is hot and painful, or oozes pus, treat it with heat. Put hot, moist cloths on it (hot compresses).


 If the skin shows signs of serious infection such as:

    - inflammation (redness or darkening of skin around the affected areas)
    - swelling
    - pain
    - heat (it feels hot)
    - pus

  Do the following:

    - Keep the affected part still and elevate it (put it higher than the rest of the body).
    - Apply hot, moist cloths.
    - If the infection is severe or the person has a fever, give antibiotics (penicillin, a sulfonamide, or erythromycin).

  Danger signs include: swollen lymph nodes, a red or dark line above the infected area, or a bad smell. If these do not get better with treatment use an antibiotic and seek medical help quickly.

 2. If the affected area itches, stings, or oozes clear fluid, treat it with cold. Put cool, wet cloths on it (cold compresses).

 If the affected skin forms blisters or a crust, oozes, itches, stings, or burns, do the following:

 - Apply cloths soaked in cool water with white vinegar (2 tablespoons of vinegar in 1 quart of pure boiled water).
 - When the affected area feels better, no longer oozes, and has formed tender new skin, lightly spread on a mixture of talc and water (1 part talc to 1 part water).
 - When healing has taken place, and the new skin begins to thicken or flake, rub on a little vegetable lard or body oil to soften it.

 3. If the skin areas affected are on parts of the body often exposed to sunlight, protect them from the sun.

 4. If the skin areas most affected are usually covered by clothing, expose them to direct sunlight for 10 to 20 minutes, 2 or 3 times a day.

 # Instructions for Using Hot Compresses (Hot Soaks)

  1. Boil water and allow it to cool until you can just hold your hand in it.
  2. Fold a clean cloth so it is slightly larger than the area you want to treat, wet the cloth in the hot water, and squeeze out the extra water.
  3. Put the cloth over the affected skin.
  4. Cover the cloth with a sheet of thin plastic or cellophane.
  5. Wrap it with a towel to hold in the heat.
  6. Keep the affected part raised.
  7. When the cloth starts to cool, put it back in the hot water and repeat.
