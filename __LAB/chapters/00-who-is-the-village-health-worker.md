# Who is the village health worker?

A village health worker is a person who helps lead family and neighbors toward better health. Often he or she has been selected by the other villagers as someone who is especially able and kind.

Some village health workers receive training and help from an organized program, perhaps the Ministry of Health. Others have no official position, but are simply members of the community whom people respect as healers or leaders in matters of health. Often they learn by watching, helping, and studying on their own.

In the larger sense, a village health worker is anyone who takes part in making his or her village a healthier place to live.

>This means almost everyone can and should be a health worker:

  - Mothers and fathers can show their children how to keep clean;

  - Farm people can work together to help their land produce more food;

  - Teachers can teach how to prevent and treat many common sicknesses and injuries;

  - Schoolchildren can share what they learn with their parents;

  - Shopkeepers can find out about the correct use of medicines they sell and give sensible advice and warning to buyers (see p. 338);

  - Midwives can counsel parents about the importance of eating well during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and family planning.


This book was written for the health worker in the larger sense. It is for anyone who wants to know and do more for his own, his family’s or his people’s well-being.

If you are a community health worker, an auxiliary nurse, or even a doctor, remember: this book is not just for you. It is for all the people. Share it!

>Use this book to help explain what you know to others.

Perhaps you can get small groups together to read a chapter at a time and discuss it.



THE VILLAGE HEALTH WORKER LIVES AND WORKS WITH HIS PEOPLE. HIS FIRST JOB IS TO SHARE HIS KNOWLEDGE.
